# Business Assets

**Business Assets** was created as an innovative solution to facilitate the management of industrial assets and components. It offers a hierarchical view of the assets, components, and locations of companies, using an intuitive tree structure that simplifies navigation and monitoring. My mission is to ensure that you have quick and organized access to all the necessary information for efficient operation.

### Development Methodology

To develop Business Assets, I used the **Kanban** methodology, which allows me to visualize the workflow, organize tasks efficiently, and maintain flexibility for adaptations during development. With Kanban, I can prioritize value deliveries for users and track the project's progress in real time. You can follow my progress on the [Business Assets Kanban](https://github.com/users/pretodev/projects/3).
